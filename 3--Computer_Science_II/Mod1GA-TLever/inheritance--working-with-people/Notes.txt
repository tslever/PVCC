Regarding how information for people is displayed, the program represented by the main method in the Staff class below outputs information for each person in a group of people. Considering our Java implementation, for each person, a String of information returned by the toString method associated with that person is output to the standard output stream. Every Java object is an instance of the Java Object class or a class that extends the Object class. The Object class has a public toString method. Every Java object inherits the toString method from Object or a toString method from the object’s immediate grantor that overrides the toString from Object. Information for any Java object may be acquired, and displayed, by explicitly or implicitly invoking that object’s toString method.

To display user-friendly information regarding a person, Person’s toString method overrides Object’s toString method, because Person extends Object and Person’s explicit toString method reimplements Person’s inherited toString method. To display information regarding a student, Student’s toString method overrides Person’s toString method. Student’s toString method has an expanded return statement relative to Person. To display information regarding an Undergraduate, Student’s toString method is overridden. Undergraduate’s toString method has an expanded return statement relative to Student. The same principle applies to Employee, which extends Person, and Faculty, which extends Employee.
